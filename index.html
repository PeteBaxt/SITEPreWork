      Light and Sound Memory Game!
    </h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the game. We sincerely hope you enjoy your time here. Game modes are set by pressing the mode button, then pressing Start.
      The game mode is Classic by default, but setting it to Casual before the beginning of the game 
      will prevent the game from speeding up as you make correct guesses and gives you three strikes before you're out. 
      Clocked, on the other hand, is a challenge mode! Wait too long to complete your guess and it'll be game over. 
      The first guess is untimed, so you can take whatever time you need to get set up for the game. 
      After the game has started, you cannot switch game modes.
